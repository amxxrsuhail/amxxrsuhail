### A little about me...  <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/VgCDAzcKvsR6OM0uWg/giphy.gif" width="50"> 
I'm a **Tech Enthusiast 💻 😃** passionate about learning and working with new tech. I love building interesting and amazing products that serve a great deal of purpose.One thing that makes me standout from the crowd is that, I was a civi engineering graduate and right now i self taught some of the most in demand skills for web   development and build projects. And i believe that is one skill that every programmer should have and not just sticking on to one thing and learning more and more new technologies as per needs.<br/>
 🌐  Finding something i don't know drives me restless till i reasearch and get it solved.<br/>
 📖  Can learn new technologies without a second thought if the problem to solve asks for it.<br/>
 💬  Ask me about Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.<br/>
 🔭  I’m currently working on my pet projects.<br/>
