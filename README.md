### A little about me...  

I'm a **Tech Enthusiast 💻 😃** passionate about learning and working with new tech. I love building interesting and amazing products that serve a great deal of purpose.One thing that makes me standout from the crowd is that, I was a civi engineering graduate and right now i self taught some of the most in demand skills for web   development and build projects. And i believe that is one skill that every programmer should have and not just sticking on to one thing and learning more and more new technologies as per needs.<br/><br/>
